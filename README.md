## Creating Dev Builds with CNG

### Using EAS

1. For Android:
   ```
   eas build --profile development --platform android --local
   ```
2. For iOS:
   ```
   eas build --profile development --platform ios --local
   ```
3. For iOS Simulator:
   ```
   eas build --profile development-simulator --platform ios --local
   ```

Note: Remove the `--local` flag to build on EAS servers.

### Using CNG Directly

1. For Android:
   ```
   APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:android --device
   ```
2. For iOS:
   ```
   APP_VARIANT=development npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

Note: The `--device` flag is optional and allows you to select a specific device.

## Running the Project

Start the development server:

```
npx expo start
```

## Structure

This project is divided in two section:

**1. Project's root -** The root contains all the project's configuration files and folders. You only need to modify it in case of modifying/upgrading/installing/uninstalling a library.
**2. 'src' folder -** The 'src' folder contains all the app content.

- **app:** The project is based on folder navigation (Expo Router); the structure of this folder will determine the navigation.
- **assets:** Contains all the public files, e.g., images, icons, sound files, etc.
- **components:** Contains my custom components, ready to use. Please note the following:
  **A. Screen:** This is the wrapper component for every screen. This component provides `KeyboardAvoidingView` ready-to-use configuration that should support scroll-view and non-scroll-view, used as `ScreenWithoutScroll` or `ScreenWithScroll` based on the provided props.
  **B. Box:** Used as `View`, `Pressable`, or `Pressable` based on the provided props.
  **C. ImageRTL:** Custom Expo-Image component to support RTL.
  **D. ThemedText:** In addition to theme support, the component provides RTL supportout of the box.
- **i18n:** This folder contains all the localization and RTL support. The project comes with English and Hebrew support; English is the default and fallback language. If you would like to add/remove a language, this is the place.
