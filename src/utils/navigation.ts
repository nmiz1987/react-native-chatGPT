 * @see [Navigating Without Navigation Prop]{@link https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigating-without-navigation-prop/}
 *
 * The types on this reference will only let you reference top level navigators. If you have
 * nested navigators, you'll need to use the `useNavigation` with the stack navigator's ParamList type.
